##  Requirements

The minimum requirements for Rigi SDK for iOS are:

- iOS 11+
- Swift 5.0+ / Objective-C
- Rigi SDK for iOS 1.0.0+

<br />

## Install the Rigi SDK

SDK for iOS can be installed through [`CocoaPods`](https://cocoapods.org/)

### Cocoapods 
Install cocoapods (if not already done). Open Terminal and run:

```bash
sudo gem install cocoapods
```

Setup cocoapods in your project (if not already done). Goto your project's root folder and run: 

```bash
pod init
pod install
```

This will setup cocoapods in the project. CocoaPods will create a new project_name.xcworkspace file, a new Podfile and a Pods folder.

Add the following lines to the top of the `Podfile`:

```bash
source 'https://github.com/HenkBoxma/rigi-ios'
source 'https://cdn.cocoapods.org/'
```

Add the Rigi pod. Optionally specify the version you want to use, like so:

```bash
pod 'Rigi', '~> 1.0'
```

Your Podfile now will look something like this:

```bash
platform :ios, '11.0'

source 'https://cdn.cocoapods.org/'
source 'https://github.com/HenkBoxma/rigi-ios-pod.git'

target 'RigiExample' do
  use_frameworks!

  pod 'Rigi'

  # Additionall pods
  # pod 'SVProgressHUD'

end
```


Once you update your Podfile you will need to run either `pod update` or `pod install --repo-update` to update your repos.

Open the project_name.xcworkspace with Xcode.
